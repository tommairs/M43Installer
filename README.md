# M43Installer
Basic installer for Momentum 4.3.0

This project provides a simple, canned installer for typical situations.  It was created for personal use and may not be actively maintained.  
Use at your own discretion. 
 
The general steps are:
 - Build a server/VM/Instance
 - Save this script as something like "installer.sh"
 - Execute as "sudo sh installer.sh"
 - follow all the prompts.
 
 Any specific instructions are buried in the script and are typically exposed as part of the Bash script.
 There is very little (if any) field validation so be precise in your answers.
 
 **Secure_HTTP_nginx** can apply to any of the V4 builds and can be applied after the install is complete.  It is just a fast way to make all the changes needed to secure nginx.
